description: Reproducible data science may not be the flashiest of topics, but considering many companies are willing to pay through the roof to hire someone who specialises in it, it's certainly something worth being aware of. In this episode we talk to Becky Arnold, an astrophysics researcher at Keele University and prominent contributor to The Turing Way, an online guide to doing data science the 'right' way.
